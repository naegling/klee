/* The square root algorithm is quite directly from

 * An important difference is that it is split to two parts
 * in order to use only 64-bit operations.
 *
 * Note that for negative numbers we return -sqrt(-inValue).
 * Not sure if someone relies on this behaviour, but not going
 * to break it for now. It doesn't slow the code much overall.
